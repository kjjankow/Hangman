# Hangman
Hangman game
Developing a Hangman game in Python using an online tutorial (geeks for geeks). Utilizing some code shown in the tutorial, 
but attempting to customize based on my own knowledge. Also looking to add graphics common to the Hangman game.

As of 20190109:
- Developed initial game start and guessing interface.

Plans for next rev:
- Some error checking on guess attempts (must be 1 letter, not a number, etc)

Future revs:
- Increase library of possible words (eventually adding something like a dictionary)
  * Learning to import and read files
- Add ability to have phrases
  * Increased complexity of controling game flow
- Add graphics
  * Learning graphics (even if just text based)
